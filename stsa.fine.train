1 apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .

1 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
2 one of -lrb- jaglom 's -rrb- better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love .

2 this is amusing for about three minutes .
3 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .
4 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
3 a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity .
3 it 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can .

3 ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .

1 if nothing else , `` rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j.

3 -lrb- allen 's -rrb- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be .

3 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .

4 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer 's block ever .
2 admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
3 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us .

3 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema 's capability for recording truth .
3 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant .

3 a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .

0 a vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg 's brilliant ` videodrome . '
3 discursive but oddly riveting documentary .
0 what 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .

3 though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there 's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting .
